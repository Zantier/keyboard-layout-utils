# Keyboard Layout Utils

Provide a function to parse KLE (Keyboard Layout Editor) raw data, and do various things with it.

- Read KLE raw data from left.txt and right.txt, and output an svg for laser cutting to out.svg
- Output the x and y positions of where the key holes should, for example to do modelling in OpenSCAD
